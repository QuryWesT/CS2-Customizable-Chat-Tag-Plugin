# CS2-Customizable-Chat-Tag-Plugin

The purpose of this plugin is to be more easily editable compared to others found online. This way, you can create more unique and different features for your server. You can think of it as a beta version; it is fully functional, but you can develop and customize it according to your needs to achieve better results and learn new things.

1. The purpose of this command is to ensure that when you add a new tag and enter the game, the tags and IDs you added will be integrated into the game when you type them into the console.

2. You can retrieve the settings from the "addons/counterstrikesharp/configs/plugins/tag_config/tag_config.json" file.

3. Do not add comments like "// Name" next to the ID in the config file. Otherwise, you may encounter errors when refreshing the config in the game. If properly formatted, the entries will display correctly without issues.

4. CT and T tags are in plain colors. You can customize them to add tags for users as well. This way, you can create a server-specific setup and also improve your coding skills.

5. When adding admins to the tag_config file, make sure to use the regular SteamID instead of SteamID3.
